# CastleDefense

A game where you simply defend yourself against enemies. Mount & Blade inspired fighting system, customizable characters (clothing, weapons, etc.), skills and more stuff.
It's not even nearly finished but it's a good base for a game.

A lot of low poly models made by me in this one.
